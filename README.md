# Study Circle

## Project Description

Study Circle is a peer-to-peer study support platform created for our Software Engineering coursework.
The idea behind the system is to connect students who are struggling academically with other students who are confident in certain subjects and willing to help. Many students cannot afford private tutoring, so this platform is designed to create a supportive academic community within the university.
For Sprint 1, our focus has been on planning and documentation, setting up our collaboration tools, and preparing the development environment using GitHub and Docker.b


The platform will allow students to:
- Request help in specific subjects
- Offer support in areas they are confident in
- Connect with peers in a safe and organised way
