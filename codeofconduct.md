# Code of Conduct (Team Agreement)

## Communication
- Be respectful and professional in all messages and meetings.
- If you are stuck or delayed, tell the team early (same day).

## Work Process
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Review at least one teammate’s pull request before merging.

## Quality
- Keep code readable (clear names, comments where needed).


## Meetings & Decisions
- Attend agreed meetings or notify the team if you cannot attend.
- Document decisions briefly in the Sprint 1 docs / meeting notes.

## Fair Contribution
- Tasks should be shared fairly and everyone should contribute commits.
- If conflicts happen, discuss calmly and agree on a solution as a team.
